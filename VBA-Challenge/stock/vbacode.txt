'things i need to do:
'need to define ticker and the metrics i create
'need to create a loop. loop should identify the last row in a sheet.
'need to grab info of ticker symbol
'need to create the yearly change volume and percent, as well as total stock volume.
'need to populate ticker symbol in new summary area with change volume, percent change, and total stock volume
'need to conditionally format
'need to identify max change, max percent change, and max total volume
'need it to go through all the sheets
